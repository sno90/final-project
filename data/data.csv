While coal tar consistently causes cancer in animal studies, short-term treatments of humans have shown no significant increase in rates of cancer. It's possible that the skin can repair itself after short-term exposure to PAHs, but not after long-term exposure. Coal tar was one of the first chemical substances proven to cause cancer from occupational exposure, during research in 1775 on the cause of chimney sweeps' carcinoma. Modern studies have shown that working with coal tar pitch, such as during the paving of roads or when working on roofs, increases the risk of cancer.

In particular, rodent studies show that these events are minimal probably in the dose range of 1_10 mg/kg body weight, which is approximately 100 to 1,000 times the anticipated human exposure to this substance.

Inhalation of toluene in low to moderate levels can cause tiredness, confusion, weakness, drunken-type actions, memory loss, nausea, loss of appetite, hearing loss, and colour vision loss. Some of these symptoms usually disappear when exposure is stopped. Inhaling high levels of toluene in a short time may cause light-headedness, nausea, or sleepiness, unconsciousness, and even death. Toluene is, however, much less toxic than benzene, and has as a consequence, largely replaced it as an aromatic solvent in chemical preparation.

Tumors appeared on subjects which were exposed by 4-aminobiphenyl in a range of duration from 1.5 to 19 years. The compound can be metabolized by humans which the product may form adducts with DNA in human urothelial mucosa and bladder tumor tissues. Levels of these adducts in smokers of blond and black tobacco were found to be proportional to bladder cancer risk.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4-Aminobiphenyl#Toxicity
